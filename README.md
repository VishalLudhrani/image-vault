# Image Vault
A password based online image sharing project

## Tech Stack
- For front end, [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) is used
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is used for authentication, realtime database, and hosting
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com) is used for REST API
- [Material UI](https://mui.com) is the design system used
- [ImgBB-API](https://api.imgbb.com/) is the API that will be used
- [NanoID-URL](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/) is the unique string generator which will be used for generating custom URLs

## The problem
There are free resources to upload temporary images, but anyone with the link can view those images.

## The solution implemented with this project
This project simply stores your images protected with a password.
You can share the password with people whom you want to share your images with.
